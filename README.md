# PyBaMM Cell Modeling

Welcome to my collection of battery cell modeling projects! This repository serves as my personal playground and learning space for exploring the capabilities of PyBAMM (Python Battery Mathematical Modelling), an open-source library for the simulation of lithium-ion batteries.

Here, you'll find various examples, from fundamental models to more complex simulations, as I deepen my understanding of battery physics and electrochemical modeling.

## About This Repository
The goal of this repository is to document my journey in learning and applying battery simulation techniques. Each folder or file represents a specific practice case, model, or feature exploration within the PyBAMM framework.

This includes implementations of standard models like:

* Doyle-Fuller-Newman (DFN) model

* Single Particle Model (SPM)

* Single Particle Model with electrolyte (SPMe)

* And various other experiments and parameter studies.
